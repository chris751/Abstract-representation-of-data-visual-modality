# Abstract-representation-of-data-visual-modality
The program uses data from the AirQualityUCI dataset. The data used from this is ‘temperature’ NOx(GT) and C6H6(GT). The temperature data changes the color of the particles, if the value is low the color will be blue. Medium temperature will yield in orange color, and red for high temperatures. NOx(GT) varies the size of the particles, where a higher value results in a larger particle. TheC6H6(GT) is visualised by changing the velocity og the particles.Created for the course Multi Modal interaction in 2018.
